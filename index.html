                <h3>What can I expect at a counseling session?</h3>
                <p>We strive to make the counseling atmosphere relaxed, comfortable, and free from judgment. During your
                    initial session, we will discuss your current situation and relevant history. From there, each
                    counseling session is constructed from the goals you have identified as the basis for your growth.
                </p>

            <div class="faqs-col">
                <h3>Do you offer counseling services for children and teenagers?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Children and teenagers are often helped by having their own individual sessions, sometimes in
                    combination with family counseling. Teenagers can play an active role along with their counselor in
                    deciding what will work best for them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faqs-col">
                <h3>Are my sessions confidential?</h3>
                <p>As a client, you are guaranteed the protection of confidentiality within the boundaries of the
                    client/counselor relationship. The only limitations to confidentiality occur when clients are
                    considered either a threat to themselves or someone else, or when legal requirements demand that
                    confidential information be disclosed. Please contact us if you have any questions regarding our
                    confidentiality policy.</p>

                <h3>How can counseling help me?</h3>
                <p>There are times in life when certain issues or life events can cause emotional distress, put a strain
                    on relationships, or make it feel like your world is crumbling. Foundations Counseling offers the
                    caring, expert assistance that you need during these stressful times. We can help you find new ways
                    to cope with the challenges in your life.</p>

            <div class="faqs-col">
                <h3>What type of training do your counselors have?</h3>
                <p>Every one of our therapists has either a Master’s or Doctoral degree in counseling or psychology.
                    Each counselor has specialized training and expertise in several specific areas of therapy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faqs-col">
                <h3>How will I know when I am done with counseling?</h3>
                <p>Successful therapy depends on setting clear, realistic, attainable goals up front. When our time
                    together has a clear objective, it makes it much easier to measure success.
                    It is normal for goals to evolve during the course of working together, and it is also perfectly
                    okay and normal to introduce new goals as we go through the process. As long as we stay clear on
                    what we’re working on, reaching the end will usually be obvious.</p>
